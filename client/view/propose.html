    <p>
        This year we are especially interested in <strong>Made in Israel</strong>, which means
        projects written by Israelis, products by Israelis, products for Israelis etc.
        Anything that smells like Falafel.
        To this end we created a session specifically for <strong>Open Source in Israel</strong>.
        Open Source in Israel is a stage for projects made is israel or by Israelis.
        You get 5 minutes to introduce your work. Choose the Open Source in Israel type when submitting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike last year, this time we've decided that we will not define a list of tracks upfront,
        rather open up the submission to any topic.
        Later on we will choose the best talks and sort them by topic relevance,
        so that attendees would be able to focus on tracks and room.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that we want submission on any topic that may interest developers, product folks, UX etc.
        Topics might include startups, mobile, web, devops, data processing, scaling, programming languages, api design, data science, gaming, computer vision and more....
        This is not a closed list, it's just to give ideas, if your topic doesn't seem to fit here and is of general interest, we want it!
    </p>
    <h2>Session Length</h2>
    <p>
        We will publish a more detailed agenda later on but for now we can say that there will
        be several types of sessions for which you may submit your talk:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full length talk. Between <strong>30m</strong> to <strong>50m</strong> (we will publish the final number later)</li>
        <li>Lightning talk. <strong>5m</strong> talk with 20 slides that get auto advanced. 15s per slide. This is fun!</li>
        <li>Workshop. Hands-on workshops for smaller audience. Up to about 20 or 30 participants. The length depends on you , but it's usually around 2h</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you submit your proposal please specify the type.</p>
    <h2>What Language?</h2>
    <p>
        The default language is <strong>Hebrew</strong>. This is not an international event, it's a local event
        for local developers and by local developers. There are awesome developers here in Israel.
        Having said that, if you as a speaker would prefer to speak in English that's totally fine.
        If you are a non Israeli speaker and would like to present in this conference, you are
        most welcome, that's perfectly fine, you may do so in English,
        but just be aware that you'll find yourself bored to death in all other non-english sessions,
        so bare that in mind of you plan to travel specifically for this event.
    </p>
    <h2>Selection Process</h2>
    <p>
        We have a wonderful group of <a href='/about'>moderators</a> that would help you
        refine your submission and eventually select the proposed sessions.
        Please feel free to reach out to any of us if you have any questions.
        During the selection process we take into account various aspects, including
        <em>relavancy</em>, <em>populatity</em>, <em>interest</em>, <em>originality</em>,
        presenters <em>track record</em>, <em>diversity</em> etc.
    </p>

    <h2>You should submit your talk!</h2>
    <p>
        Reversim Summit is a community event and as such, we are looking for speakers of all levels and experience.
        There are endless reasons why you might think to yourself you shouldn't submit a talk. However, if these reasons are that you think you can't prepare a decent presentation, if you are unsure whether what you have to share is interesting or if maybe you don't know if you have the skills to get on the stage - please consider the following:
    <ul>
        <li>We are happy to brainstorm ideas and transform these into something worth presenting</li>
        <li>We are happy to review and advise on how to produce a great looking slide deck</li>
        <li>If you need practice giving talks, get in touch, we can set up a stage for you with some audience in advance, so you can practice in front of a friendly crowd</li>
        <li>If you come up with any other help needed, we will gladly help in whatever way possible. </li>
    </ul>
    {{> weCanHelp}}
    </p>
    <h2>What do you get for X?</h2>
    <p>
        Registration will open about a month before the event. If you've registered on time, all is well.
        If not, <em>submitters get a personal ticket</em>, regrdless of whether your session got accepted or not (assuming quality submission). <em>Accepted speakers get a personal ticket +1</em> (so you can do a friend a favor)
